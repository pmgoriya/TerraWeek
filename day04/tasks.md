# TerraWeek Day 4

## Task 1: 
Research the importance of Terraform state in managing infrastructure. Share your findings on how Terraform state helps track the current state of resources.

## Task 2: 
Understand the different methods of storing the state file (local or remote). Create a simple Terraform configuration file and initialize it to generate a local state file and provide the terraform state command and mention it's purpose. Check usage of terraform state command.

## Task 3: 
Explore remote state management options such as Terraform Cloud, AWS S3, Azure Storage Account or HashiCorp Consul. Choose one remote state management option and research its setup and configuration process. 

## Task 4: 
Modify your Terraform configuration file to store the state remotely using the chosen remote state management option. Include the necessary backend configuration block in your Terraform configuration file.
 
  terraform {
    backend "<chosen_backend>" {
      # Add required configuration options for the chosen backend
    }
  }
